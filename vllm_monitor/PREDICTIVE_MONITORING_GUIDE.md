# vLLM Predictive Monitoring and Self-Healing System

This guide describes the advanced predictive monitoring, continuous learning, and self-healing capabilities added to the vLLM monitoring system.

## üéØ System Overview

The enhanced monitoring system provides:

1. **Predictive Failure Detection**: Projects future system states to identify potential failures before they occur
2. **Continuous Learning**: Learns from mitigation success/failure to optimize future interventions
3. **Comprehensive Integration**: Monitors every vLLM state, exception, and error condition
4. **Automatic Mitigation**: Executes interventions to prevent or recover from failures
5. **Pre-Startup Validation**: Ensures optimal system configuration before vLLM starts

## üîÆ Predictive Failure Detection

### Key Components

#### State Graph Analysis
- Maintains a graph of all vLLM states and transitions
- Calculates failure probabilities for each state
- Finds paths from current state to failure states
- Identifies optimal recovery paths to healthy states

#### Pattern Recognition
- Learns failure patterns from historical data
- Matches current conditions against known patterns
- Predicts time-to-failure with confidence scores
- Continuously updates pattern knowledge base

#### Anomaly Detection
- Monitors metrics for anomalous behavior
- Detects memory leaks, performance degradation
- Identifies resource exhaustion trends
- Triggers early warnings for intervention

### Usage Example

```python
from vllm_monitor.predictive_failure_detection import PredictiveFailureDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = PredictiveFailureDetector(
    learning_rate=0.1,
    prediction_horizon=300.0  # 5 minutes
)

# Analyze checkpoint
predictions = detector.analyze_checkpoint(checkpoint)

for prediction in predictions:
    print(f"Failure type: {prediction.failure_type}")
    print(f"Probability: {prediction.probability:.2%}")
    print(f"Time to failure: {prediction.time_to_failure}s")
    print(f"Recommended mitigations: {len(prediction.recommended_mitigations)}")
```

## üß† Continuous Learning System

### Learning Methods

1. **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning for strategy selection
2. **Bayesian Inference**: Probabilistic outcome prediction
3. **Rule Extraction**: Learns rules from successful mitigations
4. **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple methods for robustness

### Key Features

#### Strategy Performance Tracking
- Tracks success rate, execution time, effectiveness
- Context-specific performance (by state, error type)
- Exploration vs exploitation balancing
- Confidence-based recommendations

#### Automated Learning
- Records every mitigation attempt
- Updates strategy effectiveness scores
- Extracts patterns from outcomes
- Persists learned knowledge

### Usage Example

```python
from vllm_monitor.continuous_learning import ContinuousLearningSystem

# Initialize learner
learner = ContinuousLearningSystem(
    learning_method=LearningMethod.ENSEMBLE,
    learning_rate=0.1
)

# Get recommendations
recommendations = learner.get_learning_recommendations(
    state=LifecycleState.SERVING,
    errors=["cuda_oom"],
    metrics={"gpu_memory_percent": 95}
)

# Record mitigation outcome
learner.record_attempt(mitigation_attempt)
```

## üîß Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies

### Memory Management
- **Emergency GPU Memory Cleanup**: Aggressively frees GPU memory
- **Reduce Batch Size**: Decreases memory usage
- **Enable CPU Offload**: Moves tensors to system memory

### Performance Optimization
- **Optimize Inference**: Enables CUDA graphs, Flash Attention
- **Scale Workers**: Adds distributed workers for load balancing

### Error Recovery
- **Restart Failed Workers**: Detects and restarts unresponsive workers
- **Clear Errors**: Resets error state and counters
- **Restart NCCL**: Reinitializes communication layer

### Configuration
- **Validate and Fix Config**: Detects and corrects misconfigurations
- **Pre-Startup Configuration**: Sets optimal OS/environment settings

### Example Strategy Implementation

```python
class EmergencyGPUMemoryCleanup(MitigationStrategy):
    def execute(self, context):
        # Clear CUDA cache
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()
        
        # Force garbage collection
        gc.collect()
        
        # Kill zombie processes
        self._kill_zombie_cuda_processes()
        
        return MitigationOutcome.SUCCESS
```

## üõ°Ô∏è vLLM Integration Plugins

### Pre-Startup Validator
Comprehensive validation before vLLM starts:
- OS and driver compatibility
- Hardware requirements
- CUDA/ROCm environment
- Memory availability
- Network configuration
- Dependencies
- File system

### State Tracker
Monitors all vLLM lifecycle states:
- Initialization progress
- Model loading status
- Memory allocation
- Worker setup
- Serving metrics
- Error states

### Exception Monitor
Catches and classifies all exceptions:
- CUDA out of memory
- NCCL communication errors
- Model loading failures
- Configuration errors
- Timeout errors
- System resource errors

## üìä Guardrail System

### Memory Guardrails
```python
GuardrailPolicy(
    name="gpu_memory_critical",
    condition=lambda cp: cp.metrics.get("gpu_memory_percent", 0) > 95,
    intervention="emergency_gpu_memory_cleanup",
    severity="critical"
)
```

### Performance Guardrails
- High latency detection
- Low throughput detection
- GPU underutilization
- Request queue overflow

### Stability Guardrails
- High error rate detection
- Worker failure detection
- Deadlock detection
- GPU overheating

## üöÄ Complete Integration Example

```python
# Initialize comprehensive monitoring
monitor = create_monitor_with_plugins()
failure_detector = PredictiveFailureDetector()
learner = ContinuousLearningSystem()

# Register all plugins and strategies
register_all_vllm_plugins(monitor.plugin_manager)
register_all_mitigation_strategies(learner)

# Pre-startup validation
validator = PreStartupValidator()
validation_result = validator.execute()

# Track lifecycle with predictions
checkpoint = monitor.track_lifecycle_state(
    LifecycleState.SERVING,
    StateTransition.STARTUP
)

# Analyze for failures
predictions = failure_detector.analyze_checkpoint(checkpoint)

# Execute mitigation if needed
if predictions:
    top_mitigation = predictions[0].recommended_mitigations[0]
    outcome = execute_mitigation(top_mitigation)
    learner.record_attempt(outcome)
```
